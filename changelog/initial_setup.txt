I created the initial Docker Compose stack with File Browser as the storage & API layer.  I added .env.example, .dockerignore, global gitignore entries, logging directories, and a ROADMAP document.  This establishes the project skeleton referenced in INSTRUCTIONS.md.

I also scaffolded the React (Vite) front-end under `frontend/uploader`, wired it
into docker-compose, and implemented minimal Upload & Library pages that talk
to File Browserâ€™s REST API.  A multi-stage Dockerfile builds and serves the UI
via nginx on port 3000.
