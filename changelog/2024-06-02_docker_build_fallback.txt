I changed the frontend/uploader Dockerfile to gracefully handle the absence of a package-lock.json.

• Added a COPY step for package-lock.json (if it exists).
• Replaced the hard-coded `npm ci` with a conditional that falls back to `npm install` when no lock­file is present.  This prevents the image build from aborting with the EUSAGE error that was logged earlier.

This fixes the build failure reported in the logs while keeping deterministic builds possible once a lock-file is introduced.
